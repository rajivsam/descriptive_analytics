## üîç Overview

Descriptive analytics focuses on summarizing historical data to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights.  
This repository guides you through the end-to-end workflow, including:

- **Data Preparation:** Cleaning, transforming, and structuring data.
- **Segmentation:** Grouping data for deeper analysis.
- **Visualization:** Creating charts and dashboards.
- **Interpretation:** Drawing meaningful conclusions.

Real-world datasets, such as the Olist e-commerce dataset, are used to demonstrate each step.
