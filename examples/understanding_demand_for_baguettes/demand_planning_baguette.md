### Understanding Demand for Baguettes
The demand for baguettes is a classic example of a time series forecasting problem. Prior to embarking on developing a forecasting model, it is important to understand the characteristics of the demand data. This is a descriptive analytics task that involves analyzing the historical demand data to identify patterns, trends, and seasonality.

I have written a blog post that provides an overview of the process of developing a stochastic profile of the demand for baguettes. This profile then feeds into a stochastic model that can be used to forecast future demand. The post discusses the steps involved in analyzing the data, including visualizations and statistical tests to identify seasonality and trends.
