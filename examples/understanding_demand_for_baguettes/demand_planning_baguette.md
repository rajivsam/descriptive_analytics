### Understanding Demand for Baguettes
The demand for baguettes is a classic example of a time series forecasting problem. Prior to embarking on developing a forecasting model, it is important to understand the characteristics of the demand data. This is a descriptive analytics task that involves analyzing the historical demand data to identify patterns, trends, and seasonality.

I have written a blog post that provides an overview of the process of developing a stochastic profile of the demand for baguettes. This profile then feeds into a stochastic model that can be used to forecast future demand. The post discusses the steps involved in analyzing the data, including visualizations and statistical tests to identify seasonality and trends.

This case study is useful for those interested in understanding how you can incoporate uncertainty into your forecasting models and make decisions that account for this uncertainty. The example develops a stochastic model for demand for baguettes at a bakery. This can be applied to other inventory items at a bakery. For example, you can use the same approach to analyze demand for other bakery items, such as croissants or pastries, or even for other types of businesses that deal with inventory management.
