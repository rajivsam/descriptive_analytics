# üìä Descriptive Analytics Recipes

Welcome to the **Descriptive Analytics Recipes** repository!  
---
This repository is dedicated to providing practical recipes and examples for performing descriptive analytics on operational datasets. It aims to help users understand their data better, identify patterns, and prepare for further analysis or modeling. Most of the recipes are designed to be accessible to both business managers and data scientists, ensuring that everyone can benefit from the insights derived from operational data. Most businesses do not have data on the scale of large enterprises. They do have operational data that can be analyzed and applied to improve business efficiency and decision-making. This repository provides a systematic approach to analyzing such data, focusing on profiling metrics before monitoring them, addressing the curse of dimensionality, and summarizing datasets for better human interpretation.

## üîç Overview


Descriptive analytics is a crucial step in the data analysis process, especially when dealing with operational data. This repository provides a collection of recipes and examples that illustrate how to apply descriptive statistical methods and machine learning techniques to analyze and summarize operational datasets. The goal is to help you understand the structure and characteristics of your data, which can inform subsequent modeling and decision-making processes.
This repository is designed to be accessible to both business managers and data scientists, providing a systematic approach to analyzing operational data. It emphasizes the importance of profiling metrics before monitoring them, addressing the curse of dimensionality, and summarizing operational datasets for better human interpretation. Please review the olist case study for an example of the results of this process.
