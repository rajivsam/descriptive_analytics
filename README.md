# üìä Descriptive Analytics Recipes

Welcome to the **Descriptive Analytics Recipes** repository!  

This repository contains recipes illustrating the use of descriptive statistical methods and machine learning methods to describe facets of your dataset that are relevant to main machine learning task. For example, if your data contains multiple populations, a descriptive task will capture this information. This informs how you want to build machine learning models for this data. In other words, if there is structure in the data that is relevant to your principal machine learning tasks, you need a process component to capture and profile this. This is what descriptive analytics aims to do.xs

## üîç Overview

his repository contains recipes to describe datasets with the following elements:
1. The raw data is operational and has a timestamp capturing the interaction activity of interest. Examples could be transactional data, data from your health/fitness application, your blood glucose monitor.
2. Your use case needs to analyze specific metrics across a time period. This time period is present in the raw dataset.
3. You apply an aggregation and or a pivoting operation to compute the metric of interest for the time period
4. You analyze the cleaned and prepared data for the time period using descriptive analytics techniques.
5. An example is provided using ecommerce data. 

Real-world datasets, such as the Olist e-commerce dataset, are used to demonstrate each step.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/descriptive_analytics.git
     cd descriptive_analytics
     ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Explore the conceptual documents and examples:**
   - Read the concept discussions in the `concept_discussion/` directory.
   - Pick a case study from the `examples/` directory to follow the implementation sketch.
