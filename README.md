# üìä Descriptive Analytics Recipes

Welcome to the **Descriptive Analytics Recipes** repository!  
---
This repository contains recipes illustrating the use of descriptive statistical methods and machine learning methods to describe facets of your dataset that are relevant to main machine learning task. For example, if your data contains multiple populations, a descriptive task will capture this information. This informs how you want to build machine learning models for this data. In other words, if there is structure in the data that is relevant to your principal machine learning tasks, you need a process component to capture and profile this. This is what descriptive analytics aims to do.xs

## üîç Overview


Descriptive analytics is a crucial step in the data analysis process, especially when dealing with operational data. This repository provides a collection of recipes and examples that illustrate how to apply descriptive statistical methods and machine learning techniques to analyze and summarize operational datasets. The goal is to help you understand the structure and characteristics of your data, which can inform subsequent modeling and decision-making processes.
This repository is designed to be accessible to both business managers and data scientists, providing a systematic approach to analyzing operational data. It emphasizes the importance of profiling metrics before monitoring them, addressing the curse of dimensionality, and summarizing operational datasets for better human interpretation. Please review the olist case study for an example of the results of this process.
