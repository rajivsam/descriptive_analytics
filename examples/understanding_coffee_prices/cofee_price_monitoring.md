## Understanding Coffee Prices

The coffee price profile I wrote about in my personal blog is a an example of of descriptive analytics task. Over time I will work it into this repository, but for now I will just link to the blog post.

This case study is useful to those interested in understanding how to analyze time series data, particularly in the context of commodity prices. It provides the details of how this time series can be analyzed. Using the insights from this analysis, one can develop a monitoring system to track coffee prices over time. This is particularly useful for businesses that rely on coffee as a commodity, such as coffee shops or roasters, as it helps them make informed decisions about pricing, sourcing, and inventory management.
