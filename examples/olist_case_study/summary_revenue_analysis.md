## Summary of Revenue Analysis

1. Frequency of purchases:
   - The total inventory of products is about 100,000 items. Of these, about 4300 products account for 55% of the store revenue.
   - Inventory item purchase frequency shows long tail distribution, with a few items being purchased frequently and most items being purchased rarely
   - A small percentage of customers visit the store frequently (five or more times), while most customers visit the store less frequently. Like inventory items, customer visit frequency also shows long tail distribution.
   - Frequently purchased itmems contribute to a large portion of the store revenue (about 55 percent) compared to frequently visited customers (about 2 percent).
   - To keep store revenue high, it is important to keep frequently purchased items in stock and ensure that they are available for customers who visit the store frequently. We need to avoid stockouts of these items to maintain customer satisfaction and loyalty.
2. Temporal trends:
   - We have only a full year of data for the year 2017
   - We have some data for the year 2018, but it is not complete
   - We have partial data for the year 2016, but it is missing 10 weeks of data, in essence making it unusable for analysis
   - We can only analyze the year 2017 for temporal trends and then use the partial data for 2018 to see if there are any trends that continue into the next year and generalizable patterns that can be observed.
   - There was one possible change point in the year 2017, which was around the holiday season in December. This is a common trend in retail, where sales tend to increase during the holiday season.
3. Geographic distribution:
   - SP, RJ, and MG are the top three states in terms of revenue contribution.
   - SP is the largest state in terms of revenue contribution, followed by RJ and MG.
4. Understanding product purchase patterns:
   - We can categorize products into two categories: frequently purchased and rarely purchased.
   - We can aggregate data by week for the frequent category to see how they perform over time. This can be done for the year 2017. We can use the partial data for 2018 to see if there are any trends that continue into the next year - check for generalizable patterns.
   - If necessary, we can also aggregate data by week for the rarely purchased category to see how they perform over time. This can be done for the year 2017. We can use the partial data for 2018 to see if there are any trends that continue into the next year - check for generalizable patterns. This step may be necessary for example some of the rarely purchased items may be seasonal items that are only purchased during certain times of the year. Like gifts during the holiday season. We can limit the time period to the holiday season in December and see how these items perform during that time.
   - We can also aggregate city data for different product categories to see how they perform across different regions. This can be done for the year 2017. We can use the partial data for 2018 to see if there are any trends that continue into the next year - check for generalizable patterns.

Understanding product purchase patterns is crucial for identifying customer preferences and optimizing inventory management. This should be the next step in the analysis.
